### Requirements

This project is being developed using Java 8 and Netbeans IDE 8.2, using only the Java core libraries.

### Assignment

The assignment is a multi-stage software development  project, in which each succesive stage builds upon the previous ones. In short it is to:

> Build a GUI application in Java (Netbeans) that allows its users to open, view, edit and finally save images in **format BMP and Netpbm** (\*.ppm, \*.pgm, \*.pbm), also implementing the features described in the *Features* Section. 

**The starting point of this repository is the complete application of this first stage.**

***(WIP):*** As the next stages get released to be worked on, either author shall update this readme document.

### Features

The application must have the following features implemented:

##### First Stage
- Negative of an image.
- Conversion to grayscale.
- Conversion to black and white.
- 90ยบ rotation Clockwise and Counter-Clockwise of the image.
- Display number of unique colors present in the image.
- *(Optimizing possible)* Saving the images in the most efficient way possible, memory space wise.
- *(Optimizing possible)* Saving and Opening of images in a custom RLE compression format.

##### Second Stage
- **(Pending)** Display image information, such as: dimensions, bits per pixel, number of unique colors and dots per inch.
- *(Refactor possible)* Generation and display of the image's Histogram
- **(Pending)** Contrast and Brightness adjustment.
- Dynamic Thresholding
- *(Refactor possible)*Scaling and free rotation (no angle constraint).
- *(Refactor possible)*Zoom in & Zoom out.
- *(Refactor possible)*Gradient calculation using Sobel, Roberts and Prewitt filters.
- *(Refactor possible)* Average, median and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filters.
- *(Refactor possible)* Apply a custom kernel filter to the image, there should be a simple and elegant way to choose the size and values of it. (Said kernel must be minimun 2x1 or 1x2 to a maximun of 7x7).
- **(Optional & Pending)** Thread based acceleration of the application in java, will only be taken into account if the rest of the features were successfully implemented.


### Future Ideas / Observations
- **(Pending)** Real-time image change while selecting threshold dynamically.
- **(Pending)** Super-Sampling in Scaling operation.
*(WIP)*
